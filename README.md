T3000 Building Automation System
================================

This is our T3000 Building Automation front end, a mature project for managing the air conditioning, lighting, access control and other automation functions of commercial buildings. The application runs on a Windows PC and allows the building operator to manage the building as a complete system. There is a small but growing team of developers working on the application full time. The system works mainly with Temco Controls products but integrators, controls contractors and other manufacturers are encouraged to join in to add their own devices and features. Communication is supported using Modbus and/or Bacnet calls over Ethernet, Wifi, RS485, RS232, zigbee and GSM network.  

The project has been around for many years and has a bright future as the system and our application matures. We welcome contributions and suggestions on next steps. Please refer to [Wiki](https://github.com/temcocontrols/T3000_Building_Automation_System/wiki) for details on how you can get started with contributing towards the project. 

Many of our products are open source, check them out on the [Temco Controls](http://www.temcocontrols.com/) web site. Most of what we do at Temco Controls is behind the scenes OEM work so feel free to send an email and ask for custom products.
